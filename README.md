-->"Traffic" was a real challenge for me. I am a driver so I could recognise all of the signs but I was a little surprized to find that the speed limit was in km/h (e.g.120) which made more sense than a speed limit of 120mph! I found examples of all the 43 pictures of signs and managed to reproduce them quite clearly. It was only a small step from there to write an AI program which identified the signs by observation with the new signs as reference. This AI program is an accurate way of recognising traffic signs and in my video I have some more examples of traffic signs.
          The program works well by itself without explanations of what the signs mean (too much text can be confusing). Too many signs also didn't work well for the same reason. I noticed that most of the signs were similar but there were some differences (mainly the speed limit) compared with UK traffic signs.
